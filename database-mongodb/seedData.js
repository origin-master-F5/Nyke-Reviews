        comment: 'These shoes were not what I was expecting.I wear a size 10 in Pegs and 10 in the Vaporfly 4% Flynit so I purchased the React Infinity Run in a size 10. With the Flynit upper on the React Infinities, I was expecting a foot hugging fit and feel similar to the Vaporfly Flynit.That was not the case with React Infinities.The heel stability is frustratingly sloppy.During my first 7 mile run in them this evening, they definitely felt very soft and comfortable, but it also felt like my heel kept slipping out, which bothered me because I couldn\'t stop thinking about it the for the entire run. My heels did not feel locked in at all like they do in the Vaporflys and not as secure as in the Pegs. To make matters worse, Nike did not include the extra pair of eyelets at the top of the lacing system to create the "runner\'s loop" that provides a more secure fit for the hindfoot. The wider toe box also seems to take away from foot hugging purpose of the Flynit. Additionally, the Flynit did not seem to respond all that well when turning through corners. I keep getting a sliding sensation of my feet in the React Infinities during these portions of my run. I do believe a size 10 was correct size for me in these because my toes would have been touching the front of the shoe with a 9.5. I honestly don\'t understand why Flynit was used on these trainers. Flynit is lightweight and makes sense of racing shoes, but why is it needed on everyday training or recovery shoes? Saving a couple ounces just doesn\'t seem worth it on a pair trainers.',

        comment: 'I am exclusive Nike user when it comes to running so this review is incredibly biased. That being said, I have this in a 4 shoe rotation right now with 2 pairs of Pegasus Turbo 1\'s and a pair of Turbo 2\'s. The Turbo 1 is my favorite Nike trainer of all time. The infinity reacts are an awesome addition. I agree with some of the other comments that this is a great recovery day trainer. That\'s solely what I have been using it for and have done nothing outside with it yet, only treadmill work so far, which is why I gave it an average on durability because I just don\'t know how it handles outside. Based on the outsole, I would say its a definite improvement over the previous reacts which were not durable at all on the out sole. These reacts are roomier in toe and the flyknit is unbeatable when it comes to comfort. The upper is basically a glove like fit and there is no tongue, its all integrated. The laces have been great and do not come untied unlike some other running shoes Nike has put out, i.e. the Turbo 2\'s, and the Next%\'s. Cushioning is great, although the heel is really squishy if you\'re a hard core heel striker. The fore foot is wide and incredibly supportive. The mid foot cushioning is a stiffer than the heel and the way the shoe is designed, I feel like it gets me on my toes a little more ( I am a mid foot striker). The white and salmon color looks killer btw. Hope they come out with more colors. I think this shoe could be an all around trainer but I am not there with it yet. I definitely would not race in these but that\'s also due to the fact that I have Next%\'s.',

However, after buying these shoes and started to run again after a recovery period, these feel like they support my feet and overall form way better! Super comfy and durable, the only slight negative that doesn\'t make them 5 star is they are little bit slippy on the heel... this soon stops after running though. Overall, very happy with how they have helped my running!',

        comment: 'I honestly wanted these shoes to work. I am back to running from a 3 year injury hiatus, and with all the research and hype built around the Nike infinity react, I was intrigued that these would be the perfect running shoes in hopes to keep me running injury free as I make my comeback into the running scene. Well I’m sorry to say...despite the hype, the new spacious fit from the flyknit loft and the initial all around feel with the 24% react foam compared to its predecessors, after 40 miles of running, the React foam just gets too soft and unstable to the point my feet are just fatigued each and every time post run. Now although it’s supposed to be another supportive option from the flagship Zoom structure, if you’re low arched to flat footed, and maybe with some moderate to excessive overpronation regardless of gait and foot mechanics, this may not be the best shoe for you. I tried but I have to got to stick firmer cushioning and more structured support from the Zoom structure 22.',

The mid-sole retains its cushion regardless of the cold temperature. The upper bootie does a great job of keeping the snow and slush out. I am getting very good traction on light covered snowy sidewalks and roadways, anything deeper and your not going to have the best traction. Regarding sizing they my feet are normal width and the shoe fits perfectly. I highly recommend this shoe for cold snowy winter running.',

        comment: 'Sizing is always subjective but I normally wear a 9 and had to buy an 8.5 US in this shoe. Now it fits perfect and the fit is awesome. Honestly if Nike made a vented summer version of this shoe I would run in this year around. More so for the upper. I love the simplicity of the closure system and secure fit. I personally hate traditional shoe laces and find them outdated and cumbersome. This is the future and a vision of what will be standard at some point in some version of design. It just makes since. I would be interested in seeing this upper on a more off-road trail worthy sole like what we are seeing with Nike\'s trail line of running shoes. And Nike if you read this, make a low price shoe gaiter for your trail running shoes. Something that can detach and be available for nasty mud / snow days. It won\'t affect sales of this shoe and will enhance the running experience with customers who buy low top running shoes in general.',

        comment: 'I have ran over one thousand miles the last two years and have worn many different types pf Nike running shoes. Nike keeps making the best even better. I have run in the Free Run Flyknit, the Epic React Flyknit 1, the Rise React Flyknit and now React Infinity Run Flyknit. My immediate impression when first putting on the shoe was how stable the shoe is, it has wider bases at the toes and heels. I also believe the design has a new inner arch support that is noticeable at first but is not noticeable after a few steps. The shoes are extremely well made and light as a feather. Aside from the she looking great, the performance is amazing. The Epic react foam in the souls seems to be the best one i’ve worn yet. Really springy and feels like you are running on clouds. You can feel an immediate difference when you take the shoes off and switch to a different shoe. If you are looking for a really comfortable shoe that also provides the highest level of performance, these shoes are it!',

        comment: 'This is really a quality running shoe. I have moved away from buying Nikes lately because the shoes I bought didn\'t often live up to my expectations based on Nike\'s description and characteristics of shoes. However, after reading a lot of positive reviews I invested in this shoe and it was everything I had hoped for. I am 70 years old and currently training for my 9th marathon. My arches are fairly low to medium and I weigh 170 pounds. I normally wear a neutral shoe. Most of my work is done on the road unless there is really inclimate weather and then I use the treadmill. I got this shoe hoping to find something that I could train in the last 6 weeks or so and then wear in the marathon. I wanted something that was comfortable but not "squishy" and heavy like a lot of cushioned models. I found that this shoe gave me exactly what I wanted. The shoe gives me unbelievable comfort without being "weighty". I still get that feeling for the road without the discomfort of pounding or jarring. I normally use different model shoes for long runs and speed/tempo work, but I find that I can use these for all workouts. I am really impressed with the amount of room in the toe box area. I have medium width feet and find that there is plenty of room for the toes without the feeling of them being "crunched" together. I highly recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe for the roads.',

        comment: '5/5. I run 10-20 miles a week when in training. As a casual runner weighing around 190 lbs, I can feel the upgrades to this model and can see why this will be a beloved running shoe. For sizing, they are true to size, 1/2 size up if you\'re a wide footer. Compared to the Epic React Flyknits 1 & 2, the upper is upgraded to a more durable material than the normal flyknit upper. The newly tooled react midsole and soles is more responsive/durable which is great for your longer/off road(ie. Trackfield, usual flat surfaces) runs. The additional rubber on the soles helps a lot not just in traction but with durablility compared to the react flyknit model. I usually tend have the Pegasus for my go-to model to run with as its a more neutrual/stable shoe for my longer runs. With the Infinity Runs, I can definately see these as my go-to when I want a springy bounce in my step for my 5 mile - half marathon runs. Will definately be using these for my training for the upcoming Nike LA 13.1 run on April 5th.',

I thought this was an Epic with a roomy toe box and rocker but, to me - a mid foot striker, it feels more like a Pegasus Turbo. The tongue area material is different (much better) and doesn’t bunch for me. This could be a great shoe for someone who doesn’t own different shoes for different purposes. For me personally, it’s an answer to a problem I didn’t have. Guided a athlete to a half marathon at a pace 2m/m slower than what I’d run solo and found these shoes to be very comfortable and reinforced proper biomechanics.',

In addition to addressing all the issues with the Epic Reacts by making the flyknit fit better, giving the outsole rubber more coverage and adding more foam they've really taken it to the next level with the wider stance and rocker design. The shoe feels incredibly stable and really encourages a proper foot strike, more so then any shoe I've ever ran in. The rocker shape is great too and really gives you the feeling of being propelled a little bit forward. Even though the shoes are a little on the heavy side compared to say the Peg Turbo 2 they really make up for it with the combination of features that will make these a great choice to put a ton of miles on while training for races. Highly recommend anyone include these in their shoe rotation!

I love the freshness in look as well as the hint of pink (the colour looks great in real) and the throughout detailing for the shoes. The shoe has great support around the mid foot which is greater than the heels (it has a 9mm drop) which naturally leads to a mid foot strides and helps me increase the pace. The packaging includes a nike resistance band and a magnetic mirror which are amazing too. The upper of shoe is an engineered mesh and looks great having a hint of pink. I am a week in using the shoes and will definitely update regarding the durability of the shoes and reduced injury but the first impressions are that it’s a superior pair of shoes and the greater mid sole design will definitely help in reducing the injuries. The run in the shoes felt comfortable and the shoes feel light. I haven’t felt any pain so far and planning for it to continue.The outsoles has great rubber support which I am really impressed by. It helped in running in a cold weather in winter. The rubber support also provides great non slip support for road runs.',

Most excited to pack them for my euro trip to keep me on track for a half-marathon!!!',

        comment: 'I broke my pair out for the first time yesterday, they are incredibly comfortable, the React has been taken to a new level with these. The biggest improvement over past react shoes is the fit of the foot, the toe box is wider and more comfortable, the flyknit also seems cleaner and stronger than the Epic React. I would highly recommend these if you are looking for a new running shoe. Go with your normal size also, they fit pretty true and maybe even slightly bigger than Epic React 1\'s or 2\'s.',

        comment: 'You know those Saturday afternoons, when you pull up Instagram and see your running friends just completed an awesome long run, but you couldn\'t go because of your nagging injuries that won\'t go away. This shoe is the answer to make sure that you won\'t have to feel that way again. It will not only allow to keep showing up for Saturdays, but you\'ll even get back out there on Sunday for the easy run you skip every week. You might even show up Tuesdays AND Thursdays for speed work.”',

        comment: 'I just received a pair of the new CruzRone running shoes. I tried them on today and went to my local gym to run on the treadmill. Felt great and comfortable in the first 10 minutes of running, but when I got to the 30 minute mark of running my legs were getting tired and I was sweating a lot. I think the problem with the CruzRone running shoe, they are a heavy running shoe. The thick heavy react foam around the heels of the running shoe makes them a lot heavier shoe. These are still a great running shoes but for shorter distances, like 5 miles. I have the Nike react flyknit running shoes and I can run much farther with them. I can run 7-10 miles with the Nike flyknits. I\'m approaching 60 soon and I run about 50-60 miles on a weekly basis. The Nike react and Cruz running shoes are far the best running shoes over the other running shoe brands out there.',

The support is outstanding it’s like you’re running on air. My recovery time is optimal as I’ve had no issues. Even though these shoes are gender neutral I would suggest going to half size up. I purchased the crimson color and have gotten all compliments.',

        comment: 'Everything about this particular shoe was perfect, except the awkward slope in the sole. I felt like my feet were sliding down cramming my toes (similar to high heels). I have a huge arch and weigh 110 lbs. I loved the width, length, and the sole did feel amazingly comfortable. I felt like the ball area of the foot needed to be higher in the sole or little grippers in the sole to keep your feet from sliding down. I only tried on these shoes and took a few steps to my immediate dismay, and I am returning these shoes.',
